Dear Editor,

I am submitting our revised manuscript, "Optimizing RPL with a Hybrid GA-RL Approach: Field-Validated Performance for IoT WSNs," as a Regular Manuscript to the IEEE Internet of Things Journal. Following the reviewerâ€™s feedback, I have completed the abstract, provided a full references list, deepened the GA-RL integration explanation (Section IV.B.1), finished truncated sections (VI.F, VI.G, VII), corrected typographical errors, and enhanced figure/table clarity (e.g., Fig. 7, Fig. 16, Fig. 17). The manuscript includes 19 figures and 28 references, with data and code intended to be available at https://github.com/faraj01/rpl-ga-rl-2025. The repository currently contains placeholder files (simulation code, Taif deployment data, documentation), which will be replaced with actual data upon availability. I request re-review and appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,
Hamzah Faraj
